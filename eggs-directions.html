<li>Crack eggs on a flat surface (helps ensure shells stay out of the mix) into a bowl that's deep enough for some serious whisking.</li>
<li>Add milk to eggs, and whisk thoroughly. Using a fork to whisk is perfectly fine; just be sure to whisk the eggs until all of the yolks and whites are thoroughly mixed together.</li>
<li>Melt a teaspoon of butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat</li>
<li>When the butter starts to bubble, or a drop of water added to the pan sizzles, slowly pour in the egg mixture.</li>
<li>Immediately reduce the heat to medium-low and as soon as the eggs begin to "set" or form a slightly solid base (a minute or two), gently stir with a rubber spatula.</li>
<li>Gently scrap the bottom of the pan, turning the eggs until almost all of the egg mixture has cooked through but there are still a few wet areas.</li>
 <li>Remove the pan from the heat and continue to stir until the eggs finish cooking using only the residual heat from the pan.</li>
 <li>Add herbs, salt and pepper to taste.</li>
